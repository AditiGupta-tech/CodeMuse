Code:
void deleteNode(int key) {
    if (!tail) return;
struct Node *current = tail->next, *prev=tail;

    do {
        if (current->data == key) {
        prev->next = current->next;
   if (current == tail) {
tail = (current == tail->next)?NULL:prev;
 }         
       free(current);
       return;
  }
        prev = current;
        current = current->next;
    } while (current != tail->next);
}

T(n): O(n) for all cases

S(n): O(1)
