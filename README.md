Hello Viewers!

Welcome to CodeMuse.

CodeMuse is a website which solves pain of most engineering students, ptobably in 1st and 2nd years where they are learning DSA in C++/Java and their college teaches it in C.
(Hey- I was amongst you just sometime back)

So what were you all doing till now? Asking all codes from gpt right? Too much hardwork!!

What if there's a site which already has all the algorithms in C? Sounds cool?

That's where CodeMuse comes to play! 

Features:
  - All DSA algorithms
  - Download a pdf with all the codes
  - Save your codes on the website

So, no more gpt and no more stress! Because CodeMuse will make you exam ready...

Wanna know a fun fact? These are the same codes that helped me score well in my DSA exam :)

Happy learning!
